<h3>May, 2020</h3>
<p>This Notice provides information about what Firefox Voice collects and how we might share it.</p>
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<h3>Voice recordings</h3>
<p>To process and carry out your command, a recording of your command and a transcript of your recording are created. Once the command is completed, we immediately delete the recording and transcription, unless you allow Mozilla to store them.</p>
<p>To help us improve Firefox Voice, you may choose to allow Mozilla to store your voice commands and transcripts of your commands. We store this data without personally identifiable information, which means we don’t know who said them.</p>
<h3>Interaction data</h3>
<p>Mozilla receives technical data from Firefox Voice related to performance of the feature, such as browser type and time needed to process submitted recordings.</p>
<h3>Technical data</h3>
<p>Mozilla receives metrics information including the number of voice samples recorded, session length and outcome, results provided by Firefox Voice, and whether those results are modified or selected.</p>
<h2>Information we share</h2>
<p>Firefox Voice shares data with service providers to provide and improve our services.</p>
<p>Here’s who we use to support Firefox Voice:</p>
<h3><a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms">Google Cloud Speech Service</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We share your audio recording with Google Cloud’s speech-to-text service to assist us in processing and carrying out your commands. Audio recordings are shared without personally identifiable metadata, and we’ve instructed Google’s service not to retain the audio or transcript associated with a command after it processes the command</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://www.rev.com/about/privacy">Rev</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to allow Mozilla to store your audio recordings, we may share your recordings with Rev to manually review and transcribe them. Audio recordings are shared without personally identifiable metadata, and we’ve instructed Rev’s service not to retain the audio or transcript associated with a command after it reviews the command.</li>
</ul>
